      Mental Health Awarness Week was started two years ago by BX21 students. They felt that mental health was an important topic to discuss, especially in a program as intense as the Bachelor's degree.
Thanks to the improved health situation and the determination of the students who took charge of the organization, this year's Mental Health Week had the best impact we've had so far in the Bachelor's.
We divided the week's events into categories: "self-care" events and more learning-oriented events, such as lectures, etc.
It's easy to get caught up in studying and forget the importance of self-care and listening to yourself. We hope that the events we have organized have helped students refocus and meditate.
